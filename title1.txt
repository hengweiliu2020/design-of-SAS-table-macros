ITT population

Notes: [a] p-value is from a log-rank test stratified by Factor 1 (Level 1 vs Level 2) and Factor 2 (Level 1 vs Level 2 vs 
Level 3). [b] Hazard ratio is from a stratified proportional hazards model with a single factor of treatment group, 
stratified by Factor 1 (Level 1 vs Level 2) and Factor 2 (Level 1 vs Level 2 vs Level 3).  Hazard ratio < 1 favors Treatment A.
+ = censored observation, NE = not estimable
