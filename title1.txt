Table 1: Summary of BICR-Assessed Progression-Free Survival (PFS) – Stratified Analysis; ITT Population (Study HRUS 1001)

Notes: [a] p-value is from a log-rank test stratified by Factor 1 (Level 1 vs Level 2) and Factor 2 (Level 1 vs Level 2 vs 
Level 3). [b] Hazard ratio is from a stratified proportional hazards model with a single factor of treatment group, 
stratified by Factor 1 (Level 1 vs Level 2) and Factor 2 (Level 1 vs Level 2 vs Level 3).  Hazard ratio < 1 favors Treatment A.
+ = censored observation, NE = not estimable

Table 4:  Summary of BICR-Assessed Objective Response Rate (ORR); ITT Population (Study HRUS 1001)
Notes: [1] ORR is defined as the complete response rate + partial response rate, per independent reader by RECIST guideline 
version 1.1; confidence interval is based on the Clopper-Pearson method.
[2] The stratification factors are Factor 1 (Level 1 vs Level 2) and Factor 2 (Level 1 vs Level 2 vs Level 3).
